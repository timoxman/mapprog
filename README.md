a little game to inspire me to learn to code

The game is set in pictureseque Lewisham (it's better than you think) and you play me, you have to get me home (probably from the pub, 
although this isn't specified) by walking around the wonderful mystical world of Lewisham (it's up and coming)
Along the way, find the name of my neighbour's dog, my local pub and park. The aim of the game is to find the name of the 
street I live on. There is a prize if you private slack me the name of my road. (not sure what the prize is, it might be rather rubbish )

To run the program use: ruby mappy1.rb map1.txt

Only command in the game I guarentee to work is 'h' for help.. work the rest out for yourself.

warning: 
this is the first proper thing I ever wrote in Ruby, so sorry its not too polished.
please feel free suggest new functionaility to add.
The current functionaility has really been written to trial will bits of syntax I have learn't. Rather than trying to build 
some lovely functionaility I have imagined.. (SOD - syntax orientated design!)
Any similarity to the real London town of Lewisham is purely coinsidental and any offense caused was probaly meant!

Have fun!!

Might even inspire you to visit or live in Lewisham (during daylight hours only)
